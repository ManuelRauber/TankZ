# TankZ

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ManuelRauber/TankZ.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ManuelRauber/TankZ)

TankZ is my first Unity 2D project. 

TankZ will be a little 2D game with human controlled tanks. Goal is - of course - to dominate the map. I currently don't have any idea, in which direction this game will go. :) 

For more information please feel free to head over to my blog: http://manuel-rauber.com/category/unity/tankz/

You can always find a release at https://tankz.azurewebsites.net. It may not be build from the current source code, but here is a [Release Log](release.md)

## Idea list

Even if I don't have a plan what exactly TankZ will be, here is a little list of things, which are needed or sound like a nice idea:

* Main menu
* Options
	* Rebind Key Mappings
* Human vs CPU
* Human vs Human
* Maps
* Obstacles
* Night/Day-Maps or cycles?
* Light
	* Blocked by obstacles?
* Nice little effects (smoke, explosions and all the fancy stuff)
* Network-Multiplayer
* Cross plattform
	* Desktop
	* Web (Unity WebGL)
	* Mobile? 
* Character creation (Kenney Character Pack)
* Achievements (Kenny Medals)
* Terrain
	* Tank should be slower in certain terrain
	* can be faster on roads (Kenney Roads Pack)
